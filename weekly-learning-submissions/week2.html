          <h4>IBM Optim</h4>
          <p>Data Masking, Synthetic Data Generation</p>
          <p>
            Data management tool that includes features for data masking and
            synthetic data generation. Data masking is what sensitive data is
            replaces with realistic but fictional data. This reduces the risk of
            exposing information during testing and development. Synthetic data
            generation is when artificial data mimics the characteristics of
            real data, which ensures data privacy while maintaining integrity.

          <p>
            A collection of applications developed by Microsoft. It is used for
            creating and managing documents, analyzing data, and communicating
            information effectively. I personally have never heard of
            <a

            before, and as I read into it, it has so many useful
            functionalities. It can be used to make flowcharts, Org charts,
            floor plans, for brainstorming, and network diagrams amongst other
            features, I'm sure.
          </p>

          <h4>JIRA</h4>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> is a
            project management tool by Atlassian. It is used for task tracking
            and I imagine that mostly for agile project management at Ally. Jira
            allows teams to create and organize tickets, assign them to members,
            track progress, and collaborate on them. I know that Ally uses Scrum
            methodologies and the agile projects we have had have been helpful
            in understanding how it works.

            >
            is was also developed by Atlassian as a collaborative and
            documentation tool. Confluence has more of a wiki-based content
            management tool where teams can create, organize, and share
            information and documentation. I assume that Ally uses this tool for
            project documentations, knowledge bases, and as a team collaboration

            Both Ansible and Terraform are powerful but different open source IT
            DevOp tools that are often compared for their features. These tools
            can work together and are better when working together for a better
            experience for developers and teams. Both of these tools have a

          <h4>Ansible</h4>

              >Ansible</a
            >
            is an IT automation engine that automates provisioning,
            configuration management, application deployment, orchestration and
            many other features. It works by connecting to nodes and push out
            small projects, called modules. Those projects are written to be a
            resource model for the desired state of the system. Ansible is also
            agentless, meaning that it does not requires any any software to be
            installed in devices. This is possible because Ansible uses SSH
            protocol to connect to servers and run tasks. It can also large
            groups of computer systems.

          <h4>Terraform</h4>

            <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is an
            infrastructure as code that allows users to build, change, and
            version cloud resources safely and efficiently. It creates and
            manages resources on cloud platforms through their application
            programming interfaces. The workflow of Terraform consists of 3
            stages: write, plan, and apply. Similarly to Ansible, Terraform is
            also agentless.

          <p>
            This week, still on a less technical side of things, I was able to
            research some of Ally's specific tools on data security, technical
            tools, and a deeper dive into Ansible and Terraform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because there was such a big focus on security from Ally, I
            dedicated another week to learning more about it. I researched the
            specific tools that Ally uses to protect databases, classify
            sensitive information, and manage encryption keys. Imperva
            SecureSphere is used fro database security, as it is a tool for
            secure just that, databases. It protects many different threats from
            SQL injection to data breaches. It also provides full visibility on
            how the data is being manipulated. Microsoft Information Protection
            is used for data classification. This tool classifies and protects
            sensitive data based on predefined policies and rules. It also
            allows Ally to label sensitive data and apply the corresponding
            security measures and controls to maintain security. IBM Optim is
            used for data masking and synthetic data generation. This tool masks
            data's sensitive information with realistic but fictional data to
            reduce the risk of exposing information during testing and
            development. It also allows for artificial data to mimic the
            characteristics of real data to ensure privacy and retain the
            integrity of information. Delphix is also used for data masking.
            This tool also helps Ally create masked copies of production data so
            that developers can test their work with realistic data without
            damaging the integrity of real data. Thales CipherTrust is used for
            encryption key management. This is a platform that helps Ally
            securely manage and protect encryption keys, which are important to
            protect sensitive information. The diagrams have been very helpful
            in allowing me to understand some of the basic fundamentals of these
            tools and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next section I researched on was on technical tools that Ally
            says they use. Some of these were familiar but also a great
            opportunity to go back and refresh my memory on some of these. With
            Microsoft Office Suite, I am familiar with Excel, PowerPoint, and
            Word. What was new to me was Visio. I researched a little on it and
            it seems to have so many useful functionalities such as to make flow
            charts, organizational charts, and even floor plans! To Jira by
            Atlassian, I am new but not new to. All of the Agile groups I have
            been in, we have used Trello to tickets, although I have known of
            Jira. At Ally, I assume Jira will be predominantly used to track
            tickets for projects. In Jira users can create and organize tickets,
            assign them to members, track progress, and collaborate on said
            tickets. Confluence is also developed by Atlassian as a
            collaboration and development tool. It takes more of a wiki-based
            management tool where teams can create, organize and share
            information and documentation in a more efficient manner. ServiceNow
            is a cloud-based format that offers a variety of service
            managements. It also contains business process automation solutions
            and provides modules for IT service desks. It seems like a great way
            for IT departments to manage and track IT tickets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I have done a little reading on Ansible and Terraform, I
            wanted to dive a little deeper and I learned about the similarities,
            differences, and how they can actually work together. Both of these
            tools are infrastructure as a code. This means they both automate
            provisioning, configuring and managing the infrastructure. Terraform
            is mainly an infrastructure provisioning tool and can deploy
            applications. Ansible is a configuration tool. Once the
            infrastructure is provisioned, Ansible can then configure, deploy
            applications, and install and update software. It can be confusing
            because they have overlapping features. Because of this, DevOps
            engineers usually use the combination of these tools for their own
            strengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the research above, I have also managed to squeeze in
            time to finish the exercises on Python on W3 Schools. I have also
            been watching the AWS Cloud Practitioner course. I created a Google
            Slides Presentation to demonstrate my learning this week. I will
            continue to add to this presentation throughout the course. Next
            week I will be shift to a more technical side of things and code a
            couple of projects in Python. I am excited about this as I miss the
            basic part of learning a new language. After that I will move over
            to R, to which I know nothing about, but I am excited about.

          <h4>What is React?</h4>
          <p>
            React is a JavaScript library for building UIs (User Interfaces).
            It's one of the most popular JavaScript front-end frameworks used
            today. It was released by Facebook in 2013, and still used today for
            many applications. React continues to be popular for its
            component-based architecture which allows programmers to reuse code,
            minimal number of updates needed to make in the DOM, a large user
            community allowing formany resources, and its flexibility to be used
            in many devices.
          </p>

            The create-react-app is a very beginner friendly tool that allows
            you to set up a react repo instantly. All you need a VirtualDOM and

          <h4>What role at Ally uses it?</h4>
          <p>
            I noticed that the AIPD (Auto Insurance and Product Delivery) role
            at Ally uses React, for both the Associate Engineer Roles and
            testing. The role consists of design, coding, testing, support, and
            debugging new and previously used software enhancements. Employees
            in this role will work in teams following the Agile methodology,
            gain business domain knowledge, collaborate with other developers,
            use technical knowledge, and interact directly with offshore
            developers and business clients.

            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/">What is AWS?</a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Amazon Web Services is the world's most comprehensive and boradly
            adopted cloud platform. A cloud platform refers to the operating
            system and hardware of a server in a internet-based data center. It
            contains cloud storage, which means that remoter servers are used to
            save data in a virtual machine in a physical server. AWS offers over
            200 fully featured services from data centers, globally! Companies
            are turning to AWS for various reasons, such as more functionality,
            larger community, more secure, more innovative, and most proven
            expertice.
          </p>
          <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
          <p>
            Because most businesses are switching over to AWS, it has become a
            crucial part of the tech industry. More and more companies are
            seeking employees with AWS skills nowadays and having these skills
            allow for a higher pay career as well. Luckily, AWS offers a free
            tier for the first 12 months of creating an account, which allows
            people to gain free, hands-on experience. AWS also has an official
            training and certification page as a resources to get more in-depth
            knowledge about AWS, which can carry over to the job. Employers are
            strongly suggesting people to consider those certifications as it
            will make your application more attractive.
          </p>
          <h4>Which role at Ally uses it?</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to the AIPD (Auto Insurance and Product Delivery), the
            IPRM (Information Protection and Risk Management) role at Ally also
            uses AWS, as it is a cybersecurity role. There are various roles in
            this rotational department. The job itself consists of employees
            participating in ecurity inversigations, collaborate in critical IT
            projects, oversee and assist in supporting technologies, oversee and
            define testing criteria for systems and applications, coordinating
            scanning policies and schedules with business and operating teams,
            and analyze the results of audits. I imagine that one of Ally's uses
            of AWS is for their

          <p>
            This week I have done a lot of self-reflection and research for the
            Ally Elective. I created my pacing guided with heavy influece on
            <a
              href="https://canvas.stiegleredtech.org/courses/27/pages/additional-context-from-ally?module_item_id=2257"
              >Additional Context from Ally</a
            >. I reflected on my Professional Skills, as it seemed this was an
            area they want incoming employees to have skills in. Given that this
            consists mostly of non technical skills, I approached this first and
            reflected. If you look under the Week 0 tab, you will notice my
            reflection on each of the bullet points. In addition to this, I also
            found myself reflecting on my learning methods because I want to
            figure out what the best methods are for me so that I can transfer
            that skill in a more organized way when I enter Ally, as I know that
            once I get in, I'll have the opportunity to continue learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then decided to shift to a more technical side of things, which is
            a great way to explore those learning methods I was talking about. I
            did some research on DevSecOps. This stands for Development,
            Security, and Operations. I learned that it is the practice and
            process of implementing security in every step of the development
            cycle. More info along with my readings in Week 0 tab. It was
            interesting to find there is a big focus on security in the
            information provided by Ally, which is why I dedicated a large chunk
            of my learning to security, as you will notice in my submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then had some time to revisit and refresh my memory on Network
            Infrastructure Basics. I focused on the vocabulary which helps build
            a bigger picture. In addition to that I also did some research on
            the programming languages that I have not had the chance to work
            with, as well as other tools that are presented in the roles
            PowerPoint. I decided to link the documentation of the programming
            languages as well as the websites of the tools used for myself to
            come back and find everything in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building off of the languages I did research in, I remembered that
            in the TechnicAlly Speaking meeting we had, React was brought up
            several times, as well as it being on the roles PowerPoint slide
            several times. I revisited the tic-tac-toe project we worked on, but
            it was a blur so I took the opportunity to reread some of the
            documentation and follow another tutorial where I created a GitHub
            user serach app. This is something I have seen before, which was
            really cool because I was able to practice with API calls. Refer to
            the top for the link to the repo and a screenshot of what it looks
            like as I was unsure about the deployment rendering. I was
            intentional about commenting the entire thing as I did follow a
            tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            AWS is a hot topic in todays climate. I have heard so many people
            talk about it and I took the time to do some reseach and was
            impressed at all that is offered. I have taken the opportunity of
            time provided to begin the Cloud Practitioner course and will
            continue to work through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the focus on security, I decided to do further research of
            Cybersecurity fundamentals. I started with reading and watching on
            what it means and the importance of it. I read several articles on
            the some of the fundamentals and linked the articles that I read. I
            also created a PowerPoint presentation (embedded above) to condense
            the information I learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, even though it was not on the pacing guide, I was able to
            squeeze some time in to start the W3 schools course on Python.
            Screenshots provided along the side. Moving into next week, I will
            continue to focus on security, and transition into Python and work
            on some more coding projects.

      <h5 class="project-description-header">Reflection</h5>
      <h6 class="project-description-subheader">Learning From Udemy</h6>
      <p class="project-description">
        This week I have been focusing on the learning and implementation of the
        programming language, Python. I took a
        <a
          href="https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/learn/lecture/2493870?start=1#overview"
          >Udemy Course</a
        >
        to learn the basics of the language. Luckily it was easier than I
        thought to pick up on the basics. The logic of the language is similar
        to Java and JavaScript. They syntax is of course, very different. I had
        to keep fighting the urge to end a statement with a semi-colon. I was
        surprised to see how strict the indenting was for the code to run.
        Normally I can use a keyboard short-cut to help format the code and it
        can usually tell me if I am missing something such as a semi-colon; this
        was different in Python. I kept running into errors or a piece of code
        would not run correctly, only to find out some time later the indenting
        was off.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see in the carousel above, I followed along with all the
        coding in the Udemy course I took. The arithmetic runs the same as we
        have learned with operations. With this I was also able to create a
        calculator (below). Also, what we know as objects, which remain objects
        as data collections, are called dictionaries in Python. They contain a
        key/value pair, which was what I used to create a quiz about Python
        basics (below as well). One of the pieces of code that I spent way too
        much time on trying to figure out why the code was not running as it was
        supposed to was the factorial. I realized about an hour after staring at
        it, was not working because the return statement was nested in the
        for-loop scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the programming languages we have learned, Python is also an
        object oriented programming language. You will notice that I made a
        'Person' class that was instantiated with '__init__'. You will also
        notice the getName() and getAge() methods that can be called when an
        object is created to set a name and age. Python also allows for class
        inheritance. This is evident in the SportsCar class where it inherited
        the Car class and overrode the methods to match its personal
        characteristics.

      <h5 class="project-description-header">Personal Projects</h5>
      <p class="project-description">
        Taking what I learned through the
        <a
          href="https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/learn/lecture/2493870?start=1#overview"
          >Udemy Course</a
        >
        and the <a href="https://www.practicepython.org/">Practice Website</a>.
        I challenged myself to create some projects and even redo the very
        traumatic rock, paper, scissors assignment in Python. In the order they
        are going in the carousel, firs off we have teh birthday-dictionary
        code, where the user can go in and seek the birthday of our activist
        Latinas in the dictionary. I used a dictionary and paired the name of
        the shero and her birthday, and used user input to look for the request
        and return it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we have a calculator where I was able to get more comfortable with
        methods. Again, the user was about to go in and choose the operation
        they wanted and then they typed in their numbers. This was nested in a
        while-loop where the user could exit the calculator by selecting 0 from
        the main menu. Then, at random, you will notice a class of 'bcolors',
        yup! My favorite feature! I had to do some digging and found how you can
        implement color in the command line! You will find evidence of the
        colors in the quiz, where I also used dictionaries to quiz myself on my
        basic knowledge of Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to those projects, I dared go back to rock, paper, scissors!
        Knowing what I know now, it actually was not so bad to redo it. This
        task was a real eye-opener to recognize what all I have learned since
        doing this project in JavaScript. For that reason, this is the project I
        have the most pride in in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the biggest project I completed in Python this week was the
        Student Management System. this project implements just about everything
        learned, including colors of course! I even implemented some of the CRUD
        functionality, except for the updating. This was was fun, but time
        consuming as I gave myself too many tasks to complete this week, but it
        was fun. You should see an image of how the code looks when it is run.
        There's something about user input and color that I love!
      </p>
      <p>
        Next week I will be continuing the focus on coding, but shifting to R. I
        will also try to make more time to work on the AWS course, as this week
        was shorter and I needed to spend time on TDD. By the end of next week I
        should also be starting to look into PowerShell for automation and
        scripting.

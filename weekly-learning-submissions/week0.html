            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I understand that being an exempt employee means that I will be
              exempt from certain labor laws, such as overtime pay and being
              salaries rather than getting paid by the hour. With that knowledge
              I also understand that there are specific expectations and
              responsibilities that come with that phrase. These can include but
              may not limited to meeting certain job requirements and
              maintaining a certain level of professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also understood that with that level of flexibility, I must
              take ownership of my career. With that, I understand that I must
              be proactive for managing and advancing my professional growth. I
              aim to achieve this by seeking opportunities for learning, skill
              building, and career advancement.

              As someone who is continuously wants to grow as an individual and

              know what areas I need to improve on to be a more efficient
              employee. Having ventured out into the tech industry, I have
              learned that I have plenty of room to grow in many different areas
              I had never considered before, and I have been fortunate to find a
              group of people who are willing to see my current limitations and
              provide insight on how to continue to grow.

            <p>
              My plan to achieve this is to meet with a mentor and manager

            <p>
              CTAC has provided me with a network of bright and hard-working

              has allowed to practice networking, following up with people, and
              even asking better questions that are more gauged towards my

            <p>
              Again, CTAC has provided me a space to practice the usage of
              soft-skills and build a foundation in technology.

                It would be great to see the participants understanding the

                understanding of the relationships between the business and
                technology. Lastly, I would like to see a an understanding of
                DevSecOps
              </li>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I do plan on doing more research on this process. CTAC is offering
              me the opportunity to figure out how to best implement a plan for
              an extended period of time. Throughout this time I have planned to
              research the relationship between business and technology.
              Learning and understanding DevSecOps is also in my pacing guide.

          <h4>DevSecOps</h4>
          <p>
            DevSecOps is the practice of implementing security in every phase of
            the development cycle. It is a necessary approach to security, as it
            allows for security issues to be easier, faster, and more affordable
            to fix. This approach also allows for everyone in the process share
            the DevSecOps responsibility and have a common goal. I gathered some
            basic knowledge of what this means through the
            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devsecops">IBM article</a>,
            <a

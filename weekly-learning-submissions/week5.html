        <h4>Health Management System Redo</h4>
        <p>
          One of the goals I have set for myself in the preparing for self
          learning assignment was to go back and redo the health management
          system. Needless to say, it was a bittersweet feeling when I realized
          that I had reached that day on my pacing guide. After rereading the
          rubric and looking back over my previous code, I decided it would be
          easier to start almost from scratch, making slight modifications on my
          models, but was able to pick up from there. The reason I decided to
          start from that point was because I am the queen of starting over and
          because I decided on a different approach and knew I had time to
          complete my goal. I decided that instead of having a file writer in
          each of my controllers, I would have one separate class to take care
          of the file writing. This would condense the user of repeated code and
          all I have to do was take care of the functionality in each controller
          for that particular class. Because I had more time, I was able to
          spend more time reviewing the order management system we would on with
          out accountability groups. I planned out the logic that I knew I
          needed to accomplish. Truth be told, it took me 3 days to get this
          project to where I wanted it at the least. There are still other
          things I would like to go back and accomplish for this assignment, but
          did not want to spend so much time on it. Being able to accomplish
          what I did in those few days did make me realize how much I have
          learned even in a few weeks. At some point I think I would like to go
          back and add some tests or integrate some JPA and Thymeleaf to make it
          a more complete app. Although I am not as satisfied with the revamping
          of the project, I am more impressed with my learning thus far.

          <h4>What is .NET?</h4>
          <p>
            .NET is a free open developer platform used to build applications.
            This means that it has accessibility to different programming
            languages and libraries. .Net uses languages like C#, Visual Basic,
            and F#, and can be run in Windows, Linux, and MacOS. With it,
            developers can build apps for the web, mobile, desktops,
            microservices, gaming, machine learning, and cloud amongst other
            things. .Net is built by Microsoft and 60,000 other developers and
            have the contributions from 3,700 companies because it is
            open-source.
          </p>
          <p>Main Components</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Common Language Runtime (CLR): The execution engine that manages
              the execution of .NET apps. It provides features like memory
              management, security, and exception handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Class Library: Collection of pre-built classes, interfaces, and
              value types that developers can use to build their apps
              efficiently. The library provides a wide variety of functionality
              from basic data types to advanced features like crypto graphing
              and networking.
            </li>
            <li>
              ASP.NET: Web application framework that enables developers to

            <p>
              Automation plays an important role in ETO's operations by reducing
              manual intervention, improving operational efficiency, and
              minimizing risk errors. The role makes many repetitive and
              time-consuming tasks more efficient, which allows the team to
              focus on more strategic and complex initiatives. By automating
              processes, ETO can achieve greater consistency, scalability, and
              have a faster response time.
